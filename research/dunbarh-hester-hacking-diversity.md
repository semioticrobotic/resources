# Hacking Diversity
Christina Dunbar-Hester

## Chapter 1: Introduction

This book will focus on the field of "*open technology*, where makers, programmers, and hackers mingle (online and off) to circulate knowledge and cultural goods, share technical problems and solutions, and generally revel in exploring technical puzzles related to coding and to craft" (p. 2); these are "largely convened in places where human resources departments or equal opporunity legislation do not hold sway, as they are voluntaristic, and they are (or have traditionally been) governed relatively informally" (p. 2)

> Interventions to change the constitution of and practices within open-technology cultures should be understood as social analysis. Diversity advocacy flows from the same impulse to remake the world that FLOSS does. It is best understood as the practices that result from practitioners' shared belief that there is an error in how open-technology communities have been constituted, one that will leave a corresponding negative imprint on their technical output, which is how they intent to shape the world. (p. 3)

"Careful attention to calls for inclusion and reconfiguring power in open-technology communities may, ironically, reach their fullest potential if they disentangle technology from agency" (p. 4)

> For all the attention paid to individual freedoms, hacking is suffused with collectivity; diversity and inclusion work insits on *bringing collectivity to the fore*, making self-consciously collective worlds. (p.8)

"Agency" is central to this work, but we should not a "disconnect between agency as an abstract individual capacity and diversity advocacy, which is necessarily socially embedded" (p. 10)

> This book does not argue for diversity in technical cultures directly, Rather, it is interested in carefully investigating the political implications of diversity advocacy. Even in spite of advocates' often clearly emancipatory objectives, some of their framings of problems and solutions contain the potential to crystallize patterns of power that contravene their intentions. (p. 14)

## Chapter 3: To Fork or Not to Fork

"When activists enaage with technology, social relations--not technological artifacts--are the primary product" (p. 49); "diversity initiatives are aimed at recasting the forms of sociality that determine how technical communities form and proceed" (p. 50)

> Many of diversity advocates' undertakings seek to challenge and recalibrate the norms of the wider culture of voluntaristic technical production. Others provide alternative spaces for hacking and making outside the mainstream. Both strategies are important within diversity advocacy. And both contrast with modes of self-organization that would allow extant terms of association to proceed organically. (p. 52)

This chapter is about "struggles over sociality" (p. 52)

## Chapter 4: Crafting and Critique

Chapter opens with an extended account of a cryptodance at a feminist hackerspace, which provides a point of entry into the practices of diversity advocates in open technology communities

"In many cases, like the cryptodance, products are emergent, fragile, or speculative" (p. 101); focus here is on symbolic dimensions; "diversity advocates in open-technology projects critique mainstream open-technology communities through acts of production" (p. 101); they are (Fraiser) subaltern counter-publics
