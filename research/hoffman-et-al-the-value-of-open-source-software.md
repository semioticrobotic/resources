# The Value of Open Source Software
Manuel Hoffmann, Frank Nagle, and Yanuo Zhou

## Introduction

The value of open source software is undeniable, but it is also difficult to compute.

> Traditionally, to measure the value created by a good or service, economists multiply the price (*p*) times the quantity sold (*q*). However, in OSS, *p* is generally zero since the source code is publicly available, and *q* is unknown due to the limited number of restrictions around how the code may be copied and reused. (p. 2)

> Understanding the value of OSS is of critical importance not only due to the role it plays in the economy, but also due to it being one of the most successful and impactful modern examples of the centuries old economic concept of "the commons" which run the risk of meeting the fate known as "the tragedy of the commons." (p. 2)

Open source price (p) is typically zero, so most studies impute it by using a goods replacement value based on the price of closed-source alternatives; this study follows a similar method (calculates the labor cost to firm of recreating an application by measuring lines of code and applying Constructive Cost Model II to estimate number of person-hours it would take to write that code "from scratch"). Then combine this with data regarding estimated labor costs.

> We find a value ranging from $1.22 billion to $6.22 billion if we were to decide as a society to recreate all widely used OSS on the supply side. However, considering the actual usage of OSS leads to a demand-side value that is orders of magnitude larger and ranges from $2.59 trillion to $13.18 trillion, if each firm who used an OSS package had to recreate it from scratch (e.g., the concept of OSS did not exist). (p. 5)

And this estimate does not even include operating systems.

> ... our results help highlight for firms and managers the importance of OSS to their production, and ideally add weight to arguments that users of OSS should not just free ride but also contribute to the creation and maintenance of OSS. (p. 6)
