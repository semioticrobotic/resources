# The Art of Community
Charles H. Vogl

## Preface

Book is intended "for those brave people who seek to bring others together to create something enriching, satisfying, and meaningful."

Contemporary research seems to indicate that "Americans today are seeking connection wither others who share their values," but "they're not involved in communities that typically provide deep ongoing connection, membership, and life-honoring rituals."

### Introduction

Communities "make us more effective in reaching goals and overcoming challenges large and small." They are "created when at least two people begin to feel concern for each other's welfare."

Book aims to help readers build communities in which members:

* grow in the ways they hope to
* feel more connected, welcome, proud, and excited to be part of the group
* work together toward making the difference that you envision
* have more fun

"Communities function best when they're helping members to be more successful in some way in a connected and dynamic world."

## Chapter 1: Understanding Community 

Definition of community: "a group of individuals who share a mutual concern for one another's welfare" (p. 9)

Features: 

* Shared values
* Membership identity
* Moral proscriptions
* Insider understanding

Morals in communities: what are the morals of a tech community? It's easier to see in something like FOSS, since the idea of charging for software is seen as morally wrong for many in that community. 

> One of the great pleasures of being part of a community is that we don't have to explain ourselves. We want to feel seen and understood without explaining the parts that outsiders don't get. We feel more comfortable and safer within the community because of this baseline understanding." (p. 26)

Example: a group of jazz musicians shortened their session time when an outsider was present (from a few hours to 30 minutes); it "changed the space and eroded the intimacy of the community time" (p. 27).

## Chapter 2: The Boundary Principle

Community members "want to know who's in the community and shares their values" (p. 33); all communities have boundaries that demarcate insiders from outsiders; these exist to help insiders feel safe and aid mutual recognition.

Boundaries can be explicit or implicit; either way, they are an unavoidable precondition for the formation of a community (community members have to be able to distinguish themselves from not-community members).

> It's imperative that the boundary is protected according to *community values*, as opposed to personal preferences, petty concerns, or whimsical criteria.

## Chapter 3: The Initiation Principle

Initiation is "any activity that's understood as official recognition and welcome into the community" (p. 43); it marks the transition from outer to inner ring (see previous chapter).

Should be clear, explicit, and immediately recognizable to others in the community; it's "a kind of ritual," (p. 44), so it involves symbols or tokens.

Initiation serves to help newcomers feel safe to explore and participate, too, clearly seeing that they haven't committed to anything or crossed a threshold they don't (yet) wish to cross).

Initiation often involves *invitation*, which can be a powerful tool for overcoming a "crisis of belonging" (when community members might begin to feel as though they don't belong, aren't members, or aren't valued); invitations themselves reinforce belonging regardless of whether they're accepted.

Pj: Noticed the "Accidental initiation" section. Where some kind of invitation exists, but it's not formally spelled out. But the initiate *knows* they're being initiated in some way. 

Pj: The Crisis of belonging! "...members become convinced they don't belong." Invitations from leaders, explicit "join us" type invitations, can allay these fears. Even if you don't have an official titel, the act of inviting can even bring the inviter deeper into the group. 

## Chapter 4: The Rituals Principle

> A ritual is any practice that marks a time of event as special or important. (p. 49)

Rituals have a temporal effect; they bridge past, present, and future in ways that create meaningfulness; "rituals are a tool to bring meaning into our lives" (p. 49)

Rituals might include:

* ritual silence 
* rites of passage
* community displays
* Play rituals

Foundation Form for Rituals: 
- Opening
    1. Welcome
    1. Intention
    1. Reference a Tradition
    1. Explain Events and Instructions
- Body
    1. Share Wisdom
    1. Invite Participation
- Closing
    1. Acknowledgment
    1. Sending

## Chapter 5: The Temples Principle

A temple is a "place where people with shared values enact their community's rituals" (p. 67); they are spaces set aside for purposes special to the community; "when you think about spaces that are special for you, you'll probably think about something that happens in that space that doesn't happen elsewhere" (p. 69)

Space affects ritual: Doing a ritual outside a designated space can be strange

Create sacred spaces for communities by:

* Drawing boundaries
* Inviting people to the space
* Donning special garments
* Adjusting the lighting
* Adjusting acoustics
* Elevating (physically) important aspects of the space and its rituals

## Chapter 6: The Stories Principle

Every community has stories; "sharing certain stories deepens a community's connections" (p. 75)

> If people don't know (or can't learn) your stories, they don't know or understand your community. They can't know who you are, what you do, or how what you do matters. (p. 75)

## Chapter 10: Managing Community Face-to-Face and Online

This chapter will cover three topic areas:

* Reasons/motivation for seeking success in/with community
* Applying the principles to online communities
* The work of Elinor Ostrom

#### Different kinds of success

> There's danger in inviting people with a selfish orientation to success into roles of authority. (p. 123)

People don't necessarily participate in or lead communities for purely altruistic reasons, but they do have different orientations toward gain:

* relative: seeking to do better than others ("relative to" others around us)
* personal maximization: seeking to do as best as one can regardless of others
* community maximization: seeking to maximize success for the group as a whole

#### Managing online communities

Online communities can overcome some limitations of space and time; they help members protect identities in cases where this can be important and enhance trust and disclosure; they make scaling a community easier; they enable recording and archving of principal community resources for use by new members

### Managing a Community

Elinor Ostrom's work on managing and growing communities, specifically with regard to long-term engagement and resource management, may be of interest here.

According to Ostrom, sustainable communities:

* have a clear group identity and boundaries
* have benefits proportional to costs
* make decisions together
* effectively monitor violators and/or free riders
* impose graduated sanctions on those who break community rules
* keep conflict management inexpensive and easy to access
* recognize the rights to organize
* coordinate with other relevant groups and networks

## Epilogue: Endings and Beginnings

Community dissolution is not necessarily an indication of failure; it could simply mean that the community has met its goals, served its purposes, or shifted its attention(s) elsewhere

Relationships we cultivate in our communities often outlast individual and specific communities themselves
