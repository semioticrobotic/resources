# Governable Spaces
Nathan Schneider  

## Introduction

What happens when various social organizations "go online"? (p. 2).

> This is a book about the poltiics of everyday life, and everday life onlinein particularâ€”among the internet-borne social spaces where people see each other and interact through digital tools. (p. 2)

Even the most "quotidian" political gentures affect flows of power "at the largest scales" (p. 2); constraints on governance in online spaces contribute to "the peril" of democratic politics (p. 2).

Defending existing governmental institutions isn't sufficient; we need to enable creative, new forms of self-governance.

Use of "governance" here is broad: "orchestrating our perceptions and reactions so as to have a chance at thriving in our surroundings" (p.3); this is not unique to humans; so any definition of "self-governance," then, is context-dependent.

Book also uses a flexible definition of "democracy": "always a horizon, a longing for power shared equitably among participants, a destination that moves depending on where one stands" (p. 3).

> If democracy is the horizon, self-governance is the plausible practice for moving in that direction. *Governable space*, then, are where democratic self-governance can happen. (p. 3)
