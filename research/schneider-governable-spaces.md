# Governable Spaces
Nathan Schneider  

## Introduction

What happens when various social organizations "go online"? (p. 2).

> This is a book about the poltiics of everyday life, and everday life onlinein particularâ€”among the internet-borne social spaces where people see each other and interact through digital tools. (p. 2)

Even the most "quotidian" political gentures affect flows of power "at the largest scales" (p. 2); constraints on governance in online spaces contribute to "the peril" of democratic politics (p. 2).

Defending existing governmental institutions isn't sufficient; we need to enable creative, new forms of self-governance.

Use of "governance" here is broad: "orchestrating our perceptions and reactions so as to have a chance at thriving in our surroundings" (p.3); this is not unique to humans; so any definition of "self-governance," then, is context-dependent.

Book also uses a flexible definition of "democracy": "always a horizon, a longing for power shared equitably among participants, a destination that moves depending on where one stands" (p. 3).

> If democracy is the horizon, self-governance is the plausible practice for moving in that direction. *Governable spaces*, then, are where democratic self-governance can happen. (p. 3)

The issue at hand, then, is *democratic erosion*, or the "deconsolidation" of democratic institutions. A significant contributor to the shifting tides may be "online social media" (p. 4).

> Even if the internet is neither a complete nor satisfying explanation for eroding democratic norms, there is reason enough to believe that aspects of networked life has contributed to aspects of democratic erosion. (p. 5)

This book adds another claim: "the design of online social spaces has contributed to the atrophy of everyday democratic skills" (p. 5).

We find solutions in "everyday democracy" (p. 5); ala Tocqueville, we see how participating in civic associations enhances politics life, and vice versa; we need to "practice" democracy at a lived, everyday level in order for it to succeed at larger scales; "a synchrony binds the smaller and larger scales of political life" (p. 7); the "everyday" is important here, too, and will enage theories of Lefebvre and De Certeau.

If "rot" is occurring in nation-state democracies globally, we should see this rot as metabolistic, as a source of generative possibility, "an act of digestion into something else" (p. 9).

Goal with this media studies-oriented approach is to avoid technological determinism(s); "these artifacts have politics," ala Winner (p. 10).

The goal here is more than "sharing the tools": "Collective governance runs contrary to how online spaces have typically taught us to behave in them" (p. 10), so in the end the tools themselves need reworking (not just "sharing").

> Tools constrain politics, but people can fashion better tools with poltiics and business models that do not take corporate control as the starting point. (p. 10)

We can observe distinct but interrelated "technological ruptures" (p. 12) that "present opportunities for democracy or whatever the future needs to call it" (p. 12):

1. Initiatives among territorial governments that introduce forms of citizen voice
2. Blockchain (or Web3, "or simply crypto")

> To design the governance of even minute comings-together is to shape what people feel they are capable of. (p. 15)

Book will propose a "sequence of concepts that constitute a vocabulary for online democracy" (p. 15):

1. implicit feaudalism
2. effective voice
3. homesteading
4. democratic mediums
5. governable stacks
6. modular politics
7. governance archaeology
8. governable spaces
